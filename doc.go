Package szargs provides a minimal and consistent interface for retrieving
settings from command-line arguments ([]string) and environment variables.

It supports three types of arguments:
  - Flagged: Identified by a single dash (e.g., "-v") for short flags, or a
    double dash (e.g., "--dir") for long-form flags. Flags may be standalone
    booleans or followed by a value.
  - Positional: Identified by their order in the argument list after all
    flagged arguments have been processed. Positional arguments can be
    retrieved in two forms: Next (in order) or Last (ensuring no trailing
    arguments remain).
  - Settings: A composite configuration mechanism that combines a default
    value, an environment variable, and a flagged argumentâ€”allowing each to
    override the previous in precedence: default < env < flag.

The package includes built-in parsers for standard Go data types.

Usage centers around the Args type, created using:

	szargs.New(programDesc string, programArgs []string)

The `programArgs` slice must include the program name as the first element;
this is ignored during argument parsing.

After retrieving all relevant arguments, the `Args.Done()` method must be
called to report an error if any unprocessed arguments remain.

This utility reflects a preference for simplicity and clarity in tooling. If
it helps your project flow a little more smoothly, it's done its job.
