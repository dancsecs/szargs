# Example Boolean Is


## Overview

This example demos the identification of a single boolean flags.  If found the
matching flag is removed as encountered.  An ambiguous error will be
generated if the flag appears more than once.

## Source

The source used for this example.  It simply defines a new szargs.Arg object,
then defines a "true" flag which identified the flag's presence in the
argument list.  Finally the Done function is called to insure that no more
arguments exist in the list.

### Successful Single Short Form

### Failure Ambiguous Argument

The error is because a true flag appeared more than once.  A second error is
generated by the ```args.Done()``` statement causing both the error and a
usage statement to be returned.

<!--- gotomd::run::./. --true -t -->

### Failure Extra Unknown Argument

The error is generated by the ```args.Done()``` statement causing both the
error and a usage statement to be returned.
